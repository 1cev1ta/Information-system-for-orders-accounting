<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great JavaFX project templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really met my needs, so I created this program. This is a program from my thesis qualification work and it provides functionality for the work of managers of the company's sales department.

The purpose of my graduation work was to increase the efficiency of the company through the development and implementation of an information system for accounting for orders for spare parts for electric vehicles.

The tasks of the work were:
* Conduct an analysis of the activities of the company for the sale of spare parts for electric vehicles;
* Choose methods and tools for system development;
* Design a database to record orders for spare parts for electric vehicles;
* Develop a user interface for a team of company managers and an administrator;
* Substantiate decisions to ensure the operational and information security of the developed system;
* Conduct an economic calculation of the costs of developing the system.

This repository provides a direct implementation of the user interface.
In the future, the project can be developed and supplemented with new commits.

### Built With

This section  contains all the main frameworks/libraries used in the project development process:

* [![Java][Java.com]][Java-url]
* [![IntellijIDEA][IntellijIDEA.com]][IntellijIDEA-url]
* [![SceneBuilder][SceneBuilder.com]][SceneBuilder-url]
* [![Figma][Figma.com]][Figma-url]
* [![MaterialFX][MaterialFX.com]][MaterialFX-url]

The IntelliJ IDEA development environment was selected to implement the functional part of the user interface.
The JavaFX platform was used to write the code.
The visual part of the interface was created in Scene Builder, a special tool for visual design UI for JavaFX applications.


The joint use of IntellijIDEA and SceneBuilder in conjunction with the JavaFX platform has several advantages.
If we talk about the IntellijIDEA development environment, then this is:
* full compatibility of the environment with the Java language on which the JavaFX platform is built
* a variety of tools for working with JavaFX;
* easy-to-use environment features for the development team.

The advantages of SceneBuilder are that it:
* allows developers to quickly create PIs;
* integrates with IntelliJ IDEA and natively supports JavaFX;
* has a convenient visual representation of the user interface.
